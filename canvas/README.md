# Product Practices Canvas

##Work instructions

**`1.`** Gather practices currently used by the team to create a successful product (15 min)

- Ask the participants  “what practices they use in their way of working to create a successful product” (do not explain successful product yet and just let the participants write down all they refer to as they think of a successful product)
- Give the participant 5 minutes to write down their stickies
- Let the participants present their stickies 


**`2.`** Categorize the stickies in the Feedback pyramid (20 min)

- Let all participants stick their stickies on the flip. (Take a picture)
`[We are going to use a big pyramid to separate the practices that have different feedback cycles.]`
- Draw only the lowest layer Functional OK. 
- Group all stickies that live in the “Functional OK” layer. This layer is the lowest layer and is focussed on proving you have build a product that is functional ok. (Output based)
- Draw the layer “Usable”
- Group the stickies for Usable layer 
- Draw the layer “Useful”
- Group the stickies for Useful layer (Often there are no stickies anymore)
- Draw the layer “Successful”
- Group the stickies for Successful layer 
- Take picture
-(Background from the pyramid is from the ‘Gojko’ pyramid (https://gojko.net/2012/05/08/redefining-software-quality/)

**`3.`** Explain the model (2 min)

`[Short explanation (like 1 sentence) per area.]`
- IMAGINE IT => In the first area an idea is generated and translated into a business case to pick up by a team (a clear why)
- BUILD IT(create) => the team builds the product/increment to fulfil the business case (the how)
- RUN IT (collect)=> the team is able to maintain their product and makes sure it performs on production
- (IM)PROVE IT (insight)=> here the business case (the why) will be answered with results (do we still have a business case and how can we improve from here)
- PROCESS => What elements are part of the team’s current way of working?

**`4.`** Map stickies from pyramid to the canvas(30 min)

- For each layer in the pyramid, ask the participants to place its stickies onto the canvas, starting with the bottom layer (Functional OK). For certain stickies, ask them why.
- When all the stickies are moved, ask the participants if they see any patterns. (e.g.: an area which they do not have much practices in at the moment, or that they are doing well)
- Show inspiration practice cards within the area (like RUN IT for example) the participants have drawn their conclusion for improvement or wanting to know something more about. Explain the cards and what it could bring the participants.

**`5.`** Decide on actions for the coming week(s) (1-2 weeks) (15 min)

- Let the team have some discussion about the practice cards and let them dot vote on which practices they would like to start/improve.

**`6.`** Feedback participants (5 min)

- Ask feedback from the participants, can be oral (were the facilitators make notes) or via stickies with feedback and placing the stickies in an appreciation scale (1 to 5 for example)

**`7.`** Feedback facilitators (done afterwards)

- Take a picture of the canvas with the stickies and practices.
- Make some notes about what stood out during the session,
- Did the participants understand the exercise(s), did you experience any problems during the session as a facilitator 
- How useful was this “workshop” (1 to 10)?
- What could be better from the tool?
- How did you use it in your context. (What was your context)
